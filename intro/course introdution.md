Course Introduction:

Software testing is a critical part of modern software development. This course introduces you to the core principles, methods, and tools used by software testers and developers to ensure that software works reliably, safely, and as intended. Through practical exercises, real project integration, and hands-on use of industry-standard tools, you will build a solid foundation for both manual and automated testing.

By the end of the course, you will understand where testing fits in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and how quality assurance supports successful software projects from start to finish.


Key Learning Outcomes
1. To develop a solid understanding of essential testingmethods and processes, ultimately enabling you to:
2. Recognize the most common software testing methods, worksteps, and how they fit into SDLC.
3. Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD), unit testing, andintegrate testing into real projects.
4. Understand and plan integration, system, and acceptancetests (manual and automated).
5. Use testing tools for test execution, automation, andreporting (e.g., PyTest, Selenium)
